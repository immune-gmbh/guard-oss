Hello, <%= @user.name %>
<br><br>
We updated the number of devices being billed, to your latest usage.
<br><br>
Old amount of devices: <strong><%= @current_devices_amount %></strong>
<br>
New amount of devices: <strong><%= @new_devices_amount %></strong>
<br><br>
<% if @organisation.freeloader %>
  As your organisation is running on our free plan, you will not be charged for anything.
<% else %>
  You will be charged: <%= @price %>
  <% if @free_credits %>
  <br>
  We will first use your remaining free credits of <strong><%= @free_credits %></strong>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
<br><br>
Here is a link to your invoices, if you want to check directly: <%= link_to "#{Settings.external_frontend_url}/dashboard/organisations/#{@organisation.public_id}?tab=billing", "#{Settings.external_frontend_url}/dashboard/organisations/#{@organisation.public_id}?tab=billing", style: 'color: #ff193c;' %>
<br><br>
Thank you for being a customer and have a great day!
